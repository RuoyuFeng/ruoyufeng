# Ruoyu Feng (冯若愚)

👋 I'm Ruoyu Feng. I received my Ph.D. degree from MOE-Microsoft Key Laboratory of Multimedia Computing and Communication, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in June 2025, supervised by [Zhibo Chen](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~chenzhibo/). Before that, I spent my undergraduate years in the Automation Department of Southeast University, from 2016 to 2020. From March 2023 to June 2025, I was a research intern at Intelligence Media Group of MSRA under the supervision of [Chong Luo](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/cluo/). My research interests mainly focus on generative models and image/video generation.
